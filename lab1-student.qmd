# Part Two: Exploring Quarto Documents

## Correlation of Vitamin C and Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| label: practicing-running-code
# Load a dataset into the R Environment.
data(ToothGrowth)

# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.
summary(ToothGrowth)

```

### Check the Data Documentation

*This dataset investigates the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea Pigs.*

*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (orange juice) and VC (vitamin c).*

*`ToothGrowth` is a data frame with 60 observations and 3 variables.*


## Creating a Plot


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: creating-a-plot
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "Boxplots comparing tooth length by supplement type and dosage."

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, 
       mapping = aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Supplement", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

ToothGrowth %>% 
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Dose of Supplement (mg/day)", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")
```


```{r}
#| label: t-test-toothgrowth
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Two-sample independent t-test comparing tooth length between supplement methods."
t.test(len ~ supp, 
       data = ToothGrowth, 
       alternative = "two.sided", 
       var.equal = FALSE)
```

## Results of the Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs
1. The p-value (~0.06) is greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There isnâ€™t enough evidence to conclude that mean tooth length differs between the OJ and VC groups.

2. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean tooth length is [-0.17 mm, 7.57 mm]. Since it includes zero, this supports the conclusion that there is no statistically significant difference in mean tooth length at the 5% level.
